> * In general, people do not see events concretely, solidly. They think more in words than in clearly-imagined pictures, and they have absolutely no idea what a revolution is, – of those many millions of causes which have gone to give it its present form, – and they are therefore inclined to exaggerate the importance in the progress of the revolution of their personality and of that attitude which they, their friends and co-thinkers will take up in this enormous upheaval. And of course they are absolutely incapable of understanding how powerless is any individual, whatever his intelligence and experience, in this whirlpool of hundreds of thousands of forces which have been put into motion by the upheaval.*

> *They do not understand that once such a great natural phenomenon has begun, such as an earthquake, or, rather, such as a typhoon, separate individuals are powerless to exercise any kind of influence on the course of events. A party perhaps can do something, – far less than is usually thought, – and on the surface of the oncoming waves, its influence may, perhaps, be very slightly noticeable. But separate small aggregations not forming a fairly large mass are undoubtedly powerless – their Powers are certainly nil. *

 - Peter Kropotkin, The Russian Revolution and the Soviet Government, 1919

@republican party
title: Democratic-Republican party

**Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Mensheviks)** - The "minority" faction of the RSDLP, the Mensheviks emerged from party splits, reunifications, and further splits in the 1900s. It is in fact the larger party, seeking to organize a mass party among the working class. A social-democratic party based on the teachings of Karl Marx, the party argues that the current revolution is the "bourgeois" revolution. The task of socialists is to achieve a democratic republic and gain political and economic rights for workers. The Mensheviks are deeply divided on their attitudes towards the war and participation in a bourgeois government.

@federalist
title: Federalist Party

**Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (SR)** - The SRs are based in the Russian ideology of *narodism*, or populism, which is an agrarian socialism that sees the traditional Russian village (the *obshchina*) as the basis of a future socialist society. Their support is strongest in the peasantry, but they have substantial support among workers as well. The SRs are deeply divided between left and right wings based on their attitudes towards the war and participation in government.
